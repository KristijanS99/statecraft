# Runs on push to main (e.g. after a PR merge). Uses conventional commits to
# determine the next version, bumps version in package.json files, tags, creates
# a GitHub Release, and publishes @statecraft/core and statecraft to npm.
# Protected main (require PR + CI) so all changes go through this flow.
