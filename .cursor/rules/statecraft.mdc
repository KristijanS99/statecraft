# Statecraft

This project uses Statecraft for the task board.

- **Board file:** `docs-private/statecraft-development.yaml`
- **Task spec files:** `docs-private/tasks/<task-id>.md` (relative to board directory)
- **Columns (canonical):** Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Done.

## Commands

Use `statecraft` if installed globally. If not in PATH, use `npx statecraft` (npm), `pnpm dlx statecraft` (pnpm), or `yarn dlx statecraft` (yarn)—e.g. `npx statecraft validate docs-private/statecraft-development.yaml`.

- Get board format spec: `statecraft spec`
- Validate board: `statecraft validate docs-private/statecraft-development.yaml`
- View board in browser: `statecraft render docs-private/statecraft-development.yaml`

## Task lifecycle (edit board and task files directly)

- **Prepare for work:** When the task has a clear definition and dependencies are satisfied, set `status` to **Ready**.
- **Start work:** Set the task's `status` to **In Progress**. Optionally open/read the task's `spec` file.
- **Finish work:** Set the task's `status` to **Done** only when the task's acceptance criteria (in its spec file) are satisfied.
- **Create task:** Add an entry under `tasks` with `status: Backlog` (id, title, optional description, spec, owner, priority, depends_on). If needed, create `docs-private/tasks/<task-id>.md` with description and DoD.

## AI guidelines for creating tickets

- **Keep the board in sync:** When doing substantive work (e.g. a new feature, fix, or refactor), create a new task in Backlog or move an existing task to In Progress/Done as appropriate. Update the board file and optionally add or update a task spec in `docs-private/tasks/`.
- **Task naming:** kebab-case, verb or noun phrase (e.g. `fix-auth-timeout`).
- **Description:** One line summary; optional markdown for context.
- **Definition of Done:** Acceptance criteria in task spec; all checked before moving to Done.
- **Task fields (from spec):** `title` (required), `status` (required), optional `description`, `spec` (path to .md), `owner`, `priority`, `depends_on`.
- **Spec file:** Path relative to board directory, e.g. `docs-private/tasks/<task-id>.md`.
