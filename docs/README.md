# Statecraft documentation

Public docs for the Statecraft board format and tools.

| Doc | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [**Why Statecraft?**](why-statecraft.md) | Motivation and principles: repo-first, CRUS, and why we built a task language for AI agents. |
| [**Statecraft board DSL — Spec (v0)**](spec.md) | Canonical reference for the YAML board format: `board`, `columns`, `tasks`, and all optional fields. Use this when implementing or parsing board files. |

Example board files that conform to the spec live in the repo root under [`examples/`](../examples/) (see [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md)).
